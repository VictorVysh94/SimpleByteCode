# SimpleByteCode
it's my graduation work. Actually was writen a lot time ago and original code was for AVR microcontroller.
What does this thing actualy do? It can execute commands from files.
There are not a lot of commands but enough for calculating some simple things!

3.) Comparison

3.1) Equals / Smaller / Bigger

4.) GOTO
# Examples
